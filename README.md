# Python Playgrounds

This repo contains all of my early Python learning and experiments.

## Structure

- `daily-practice/` – daily practice exercises organized by day
- `mini-projects/` – small Python projects completed during learning
- `algorithms/` – problem-solving exercises

This repo is an archive of my Python journey before switching to web development.
