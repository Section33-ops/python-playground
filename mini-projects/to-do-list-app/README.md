# To-Do List App

## App Description
This is a simple command-line TO-Do List App built with Python.
Users can add, view and remove tasks.
I made it to practice what I learnt using lists, loops, and user input.

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.  
2. Open the folder `To-Do List App` in terminal or command prompt.  
3. Run this command:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```
4. Follow the menu options to add, view or remove tasks.
5. Choose the exit option to quit close the app.
